# Code of Conduct

The Suncoast Developers Guild is a group that welcomes anyone to come and learn, share, network and collaborate our skills and knowledge. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in our community to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

**tl;dr: Be excellent to each other.**

## Expected Behavior

* Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
* Attempt collaboration before conflict.
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
* Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

## Anti-harassment Policy

The Suncoast Developers Guild is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of anyone in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any venue, including talks and chat channels. Individuals violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event or communication channel at the discretion of our organizers.

Harassment includes verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

## Consequences Of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. If a participant engages in policy-violating behavior, organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

## If You Witness or Are Subject to Unacceptable Behavior

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an organizer immediately.
